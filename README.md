## What is this?
Gloriosa is a game framework made for danmaku-type games.<br>
It still is in an early development phase and is not meant to be used for full games.

A game made with Gloriosa works with a "View" workflow. Think of Views as Godot's or Unity's scenes.<br>
A View has a collection of "Game Objects", Resources (textures, images, sound, music, ...) and worlds.

## GLRLib
GLRLib is a premade library to help developers make a quick game without coding to much stuff.<br>
It offers a lot of premade stuff like a boss and player system, bullets, items, etc...<br>
If you are familiar with LuaSTG, it's pretty much the same thing as THlib.<br>

You are free to use GLRLib inside your projects, but can completely ignore it or take parts of it.<br>
If you want to make your own systems, go for it, GLRLib is purely for convenience.
