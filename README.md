# Gloriosa
## What is this?
Gloriosa is a game framework made for danmaku-type games.<br>
It still is in an early development phase and is not meant to be used for full games.

A game made with Gloriosa works with a "View" workflow. Think of Views as Godot's or Unity's scenes.<br>
A View has a collection of "Game Objects", Resources (textures, images, sound, music, ...) and worlds.
